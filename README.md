## Games
Due to legal reasons, I can't provide any games nor links to them.
But they can be easily found by using a search engine!

## System Dependencies
`sdl2` together with its dependencies are required to be installed on your hostmachine.
On Arch-based distros you can use these packages:
`sdl2 sdl2_gfx sdl2_image sdl2_mixer sdl2_ttf`

## TODO
[ ] Add Beeper Sound

## Credits
